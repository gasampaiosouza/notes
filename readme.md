# NextJS Sass Template

I know it's a little harder to make sass work on NextJS, so i made this minimal template, so you can start
your projects as fast as you can.

## How to install

- First, clone this repository with <br>
  `git clone https://github.com/gasampaiosouza/next-sass-template.git`

- Inside `next-sass-template` folder, install the modules with <br>
  `npm install` or `yarn add`

- Then, just run `npm run dev`, and you're ready to go!

**Thank you ðŸ’œ**
